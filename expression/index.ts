/**
 * Expressions are an essential part of Mahalo. They consist of an
 * expression string and a scope in which they will be executed.
 * With their ability to watch for changes in their evaluated
 * result expressions are a very powerful feature of the framework.
 * 
 * That beeing said most of their magic is happening behind the scenes
 * and their implicit usage should be rare. For common use cases
 * Mahalo provides higher level access to them. Most notably in
 * a [[mahalo.Template]]. 
 * 
 * ### Syntax
 * 
 * The syntax of Mahalo expressions is similar JavaScript itself.
 * However there are the following differences.
 * 
 * #### Variables
 * 
 * You cannot access any global or local variables since expressions
 * are evaluated in a scope. So every identifier will be treated as
 * a property of the expressions scope.
 * 
 * To go deeper into an object you can of course use the dot and
 * bracket syntax just like in JavaScript. In case the property
 * of the scope you're looking for contains characters that are
 * not allowed in valid JavaScript identifiers you can start with the
 * bracket syntax prefixed with a dot.
 * 
 * ```html
 * ${ .['Â§property'] }
 * ```
 * 
 * #### Comparisons
 * 
 * All comparisons will be strictly equal on evaluation but the syntax
 * only knows loose operators (**==**, **!=**, **<=**, **>=**, **<**, **>**).
 * 
 * #### Unallowed stuff
 * 
 * Statements like **if**, **for**, **while**, **try** are not allowed.
 * Also there are no declarations or assignments of any kind possible in
 * Mahalo expression.
